## Overview
TaskProcessor is a lightweight and efficient task management library written in Rust. It simplifies the processing of asynchronous tasks in your applications by providing a robust framework for queuing, scheduling, and executing tasks.

## Features
- **Asynchronous Task Handling**: Process tasks without blocking the main thread.
- **Customizable Scheduling**: Define task priorities and execution schedules.
- **Scalability**: Efficiently handle a large number of tasks.
- **Error Handling**: Built-in mechanisms for managing task failures and retries.
- **Extensibility**: Easily integrate with other systems or extend functionality.

## Installation
To use TaskProcessor in your Rust project, add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
taskprocessor = "0.1.0"
```

## Usage
Hereâ€™s a quick example to get started:
```rust
use taskprocessor::{TaskProcessor, Task};

fn main() {
    let mut processor = TaskProcessor::new();

    processor.add_task(Task::new(|| {
        println!("Processing a task!");
    }));

    processor.run();
}
```
